#My Email

By sending me an email, I expect that you've already read the points on the [Contact Me](http://muhammadtim.com/contact) page. If you haven't, please do go back and read them, as they will save us both a lot of time in shā' Allāh. **Emails that do not meet the criteria will be rejected, so be warned!**

My email is muhammadtim, followed by the email 'at' sign, followed by gmail.com. This email is for things that are personal, as well as things related to Islam, including ruqyah, questions, lectures, etc.
