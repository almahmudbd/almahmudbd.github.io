#My Email

By sending me an email, I expect that you've already read the points on the [Contact Me](http://muhammadtim.com/contact) page. If you haven't, please do go back and read them, as they will save us both a lot of time in shā' Allāh.

My email is muhammadtim, followed by the email 'at' sign, followed by gmail.com. This email is for things that are personal, as well as things related to Islam, including ruqyah, questions, lectures, etc.

If you are emailing to arrange a lecture, khutbah, etc., please do include the word 'invite' in the subject of the email, so that I can respond quickly. If you don't hear back from me within a couple of days, it might be an idea to send me a tweet:

<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=muhammadtim" class="twitter-mention-button" data-related="muhammadtim">Tweet to @muhammadtim</a>
<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');</script>

I have a separate work email, given out on request, for business related queries.
