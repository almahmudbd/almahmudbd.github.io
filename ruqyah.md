#Information for Ruqyah Patients (Updated)

This document - *in shā' Allāh* - is designed to provide important information for patients who are asking for *ruqyah* to be performed. 

There is a clinic which I run every Monday evening in Newcastle-upon-Tyne for ruqyah patients. As a rule, I don't travel for the purpose of ruqyah, so patients have to come to Newcastle, and there are currently no alternate days or times available. Bookings are taken via brother Basak, who is my ruqyah partner. His number is given out [on request](/contact) to people who ask for appointments.

As many of you will know, treating people voluntarily is plagued with problems and difficulties. There are so many patients and so few resources. For our small clinic in Newcastle, this presents new challenges and requires a new approach.

Based on this, we're going to make the following changes to our previous setup, with the permission of Allāh:

* Our primary focus in the ruqyah clinic is going to be helping individuals and families to help themselves - **teaching people rather than just treating people**.

* This means that we require that every patient brings along someone who is going to take responsibility for performing ruqyah on them on a day to day basis.

* We will get them started by diagnosing the problem, with the permission of Allāh, and developing a programme of treatment for them, as well as training the people around them in how to carry out the treatment.

* We will support their nominated helper - in shā' Allāh - when they get stuck, and when there are major milestones in the person's treatment.

* Our role is to diagnose, advise, and teach. The role of the patient and the people who are helping them is to implement that advice and to put in to practice what they learn.

* We will no longer guarantee a weekly appointment for patients. Instead, we will prioritise helping new patients to begin the road to recovery, with the help of Allāh, and then offering appointments based on need.

* We will no longer promise that a person will get more than an initial appointment, although we will try to support people throughout their road to recovery, with the help of Allāh.

* We understand that there will be patients who do not have anyone who is able to help them. In these cases, we will seek out volunteers who are willing to help. In extreme circumstances, a raaqi from the clinic **may** be able to take on that role for a limited time.

* We will no longer tolerate people clogging up the system because they are unwilling to implement the advice given to them. They will be put at the back of the queue, in favour of those patients who are more deserving.

* Nor will we tolerate hearing excuses from patient's families and friends that they are "too busy" or "they have other family to take care of." What makes them think that the brothers who do ruqyah for them don't have family and don't have work and other responsibilities!?

* We hope and pray that those people who help in the treatment of a friend or family member will go on to help other people, and that some will take on this role for the sake of Allāh permanently.

<a id="whattodo" name="whattodo" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit;">For</a> those who accept these conditions, and wish to attend the clinic, with their nominated helper, we offer the following advice:

* Prepare yourself by repenting to Allāh and purifying your heart. [This advice may help](/anadvice).
* Stick to your regular [adhkaar](/protectys).
* Follow the [7 day ruqyah programme](/7dayrd), and repeat it if necessary.
* Try to recite the Qur'an yourself, especially [al-Faatihah](http://quran.com/1), [al-Baqarah](http://quran.com/2), [Aayat-ul-Kursi](http://quran.com/2/255), [the last two aayaat from al-Baqarah](http://quran.com/2/285-286), [al-Ikhlaas](http://quran.com/112), [al-Falaq](http://quran.com/113), and [an-Naas](http://quran.com/114). Blow into your hands and wipe over yourself, if you are able.
*  Listen to [ruqyah audio](/audio)
*  The clinic for most people is an occaisional thing, and a person may only get a single appointment. This is not enough, except for those upon whom Allāh bestows His mercy. It is designed simply to monitor you and to guide you to a successful conclusion, with the help of Allāh. Self help, and the help of your friends and family is a critical part of this.
*  Another critical part of the programme is actively seeking a cure through doing good deeds and avoiding sins. We have seen a number of cases where we feel that a person's lifestyle is the primary reason why they are not getting better, and Allāh knows best. **We will always seek to prioritise the treatment of those who are actively seeking a cure through making changes to the parts of their lives which are incompatible with Islam.**

When you come to the ruqyah clinic, please bear in mind the following:

* Be punctual.
* Be prepared to wait longer than your given time, as ruqyah is very unpredictable, and we often run over time.
* Switch off your mobile phones.
* Do not talk or distract anyone during the ruqyah session, unless there is an urgent need to do so.
* Respect the privacy and confidentiality of any other patients that you may meet. We do try to avoid patients meeting each other, but occaisionally this is unavoidable.
*  Our payment and donation policy is very clear: we do not accept payment or *hadiyyah* for ruqyah. However, we do have a charity which we have established for a wide range of Islamic aims, and you can donate to the charity, which myself and Basak are legally prohibited from benefitting from. We would prefer that this donation is made anonymously, and will post online donation details soon in shaa' Allāh. **Please note that donations regardless of how much will not get a patient any more ruqyah, and not donating will not get a patient any less ruqyah**.
* **Women (including relatives/friends who attend):** come in full hijaab, including jilbaab/'abaya, covering from the top of your head, with no hair showing, to the tip of your toe, including your feet. We would prefer you to also cover your face and hands. Do not wear perfume or make-up, and do not come with jewellery or other adornments on display.  **We reserve the right to refuse an appointment to a patient who does not comply with these rules, or who brings friends/relatives who do not comply.**
* **Women:** bring a [mahram](http://islamqa.com/en/ref/137095) with you. If you cannot bring a mahram with you for a legitimate reason, such as the case of some revert sisters who don't have a mahram, then you must bring another reliable sister with you who is able and confident enough to support you - we will not perform ruqyah upon you alone. In rare cases where you cannot bring another sister, please inform the brother who books appointments, and we will advise you whether we are able to accommodate.
