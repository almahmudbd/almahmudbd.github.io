#Ruqyah Audio

These links were part of the [ruqyah information](/ruqyah) page, but have been moved here to make it easy to refer to them in emails and presentations.

Our experience is that the audio in these links can be an effective part of treatment. However, it isn't a replacement for ruqyah, but an additional tool that can be used. We find it best if the audio is listened to using in-ear headphones.

There are many kinds of ruqyah audio available on the internet, but we have found these two to be among the best, and all praise is for AllƒÅh:

* [Shaykh Muhammad Luhaidan](http://youtu.be/0O0Q_-oc1rU)

* [Shaykh Ahmad al-Ajmy](http://quranaudiodownload.com/audio/ruqyah/Sheikh_Ahmed_Bin_Ali_Al-Ajmy_Ruqya.mp3)
