#Muhammad Tim Humble - muhammadtim.com

Assalāmu 'alaykum warahmatullāhi wa barakātuhu…

**Latest update:** The new website is well underway, and I'm hoping that this last update will be the last needed before the new website is launched, in shā' Allāh by the end of April 2014. This update has mostly been about correcting links and inaccuracies, as well as a general update of information.

I've recently added a [blog](/blog) to the site (still in testing), mostly to allow me to post things quickly via email. Those posts that I think are particularly important will in shā' Allāh be moved to the artciles section. 

For the time being, in addition to the [blog](/blog) you can access articles and information from the bar at the top of the page. Here is a selection of the most popular articles:

* [Information for Ruqyah Patients **(Updated)**](/ruqyah)

* [Ruqyah Programme for Patients **(New)**](/programme)

* [7 Day Ruqyah Detox Programme - Shaykh 'Adil ibn Tahir al-Muqbil](/7dayrd)

* [Simple Things to Protect Yourself from the Shaytaan](/protectys)

* [Ruqyah Audio](/audio)

* [A Response to Those Who Defend Ta'weez](/taweez)

* [An Advice to Those Suffering from Sickness and Black Magic](/anadvice)

* [Dealing with Waswasah](/waswasah)

There's also a selection of [video lectures](/video), and you can [contact me](/contact).
