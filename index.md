#Muhammad Tim Humble - muhammadtim.com

Assalāmu 'alaykum warahmatullāhi wa barakātuhu…

At some time in the future, there's a plan to develop this into a proper site. For the time being, it's more important to get the content out there than for it to look good.

I've recently added a [blog](/blog) to the site, mostly to allow me to post things quickly via email. Those posts that I think are particularly important will in shā' Allāh be moved to the artciles section. 

For the time being, in addition to the [blog](/blog) you can access the following articles:

* [7 Day Ruqyah Detox Programme - Shaykh 'Adil ibn Tahir al-Muqbil](/7dayrd)

* [Simple Things to Protect Yourself from the Shaytaan](/protectys)

* [A Response to Those Who Defend Ta'weez](/taweez)

* [Closing Windows and Doors at Night](/atnight)

* [An Advice to Those Suffering from Sickness and Black Magic](/anadvice)

* [Information for Ruqyah Patients](/ruqyah)

* [Dealing with Waswasah](/waswasah)

* [How and How Not to Type Islamic Phrases on Mobile Phones](/shortcuts)



There's also a selection of [video lectures](/video), and you can [contact me](/contact).
