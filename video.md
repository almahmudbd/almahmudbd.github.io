#Video Lectures

A lot of the lectures that I do end up on YouTube. 

Here are a selection of the lectures that I think are the most beneficial and important. More will be added when I have time to review them, in shaa' Allāh, and there is a project ongoing to help with this that you can volunteer for by [email](/email):

* [How To Protect Yourself From Magic, Evil Eye & The Jinn](http://youtu.be/-6J8me0RjYY)

* [Abracadabra: The Sinister World of Magic](http://youtu.be/an0BUey2eKM)

* [Al-Qur'an: The Ultimate Cure](http://youtu.be/p1zLqbVk9EE)

* [Du'a: The Weapon of the Believer](http://youtu.be/UYgBOpHtqzE)

<a id="training" name="training" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit;">Here</a> is the new Ruqyah workshop with Abu Ibraaheem. It is a comprehensive two day programme and represents the most comprehesive lecture series that I have done on ruqyah to date:

**There was a part missing - [part five](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXm6LFaTKX8&feature=c4-overview&list=UUXwQCBzDSa1wlj36I2x4BFQ). It's been added now al-hamdulillāh**

* [Ruqyah Workshop - Part One: Introduction](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2GjxuAaamc)
* [Ruqyah Workshop - Part Two: Tawheed is the Only Solution](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZUERpYaXJU)
* [Ruqyah Workshop - Part Three: The World of the Jinn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wys88S3VQG4)

* [Ruqyah Workshop - Part Seven: An Introduction to Ruqyah](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJki92e5ex0)
**There are some audio problems in the last 10 mins of part 7, I'm currently waiting for Ruqya Support to upload their copy. In the meantime, I covered similar material in the video:** [Al-Qur'an: The Ultimate Cure](http://youtu.be/p1zLqbVk9EE)
* [Ruqyah Workshop - Part Eight: The Raaqi & His Family](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Huz_ts9SpcE)

* [Ruqyah Workshop - Part Ten: The Conclusion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJQw161R1k)

In the future, and with the permission of Allāh, I hope to be able to post corrections to any mistakes here as well. Eventually, the idea is to incorporate corrections into the videos themselves. See the [corrections page](/corrections) for more information.
