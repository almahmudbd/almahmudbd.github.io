#Inviting Me To Speak

Quite a few organisations and individuals email me for the purpose of inviting me to deliver a lecture, khutbah, or workshop. To make things easier for everyone, and to ensure that - with the permission of Allāh - the lectures are of the best possible quality, I've decided to mention some important points here.

* Please be aware that I don't speak publicly for a living. I have a regular job and work committments which occaisionally have to take precedence over public speaking. I have to ration my time appropriately, which means that despite my flexible job, I try to limit myself to a certain number of invitations per month.

* Please give as much notice as possible. The ideal notice between 2 and 3 months in advance. More than 3 months is likely to result in a message asking you to contact me nearer the time. 
 
* I almost never accept invitations for khutbas, because I have most of them booked locally. The exception to this is if I am invited for a separate lecture or workshop on a Friday night, or a two day workshop on a Friday and Saturday - in this case, I will occaisionally be able to rearrange to include the khutbah.

###Frequently Asked Questions


**What kind of programmes are you willing to deliver?**

In general, I'm flexible. I have previously taught in various formats, including lectures, workshops, TV and radio programmes, and seminars; ranging from 30 minutes to several days. 

---
**How much do you charge?**

For events in the North East of England, I don't charge anything at all. This is because the people in this area have a right over me to teach and support them, and I don't generally lose any work days or significant family time by delivering these events. 

For events outside of the North East of England, I have no choice but to charge, because I lose either working time, or time with family that I have to replace at the expense of working time. I do not currently receive any funding for da'wah activities, so I am unable to subsidise the cost. 

Therefore, for events outside of the North East of England, I charge £150. This covers up to one day of lectures, inclusive of time spent travelling. In addition to this, I also request that travel expenses are covered. These can vary widely, but I do try to keep these costs down. 

If the timing of the talk is such that going back the same day would lead to getting back to Newcastle after 11pm, then I also request that the cost of accommodation for the night is covered.

---
**Why do you charge? Shouldn't this work be done for the sake of Allāh?**

I would love nothing more than to be able to afford to do all of my da'wah work for the sake of Allāh, but the situation got to the point where I was taking on debt just to cover my monthly bills. I would typically travel 500 miles, lose a day of work, and get an £80 contribution which would barely cover the cost of the petrol, let alone the loss of income, or the cost of new tires every few months. At the beginning this was easy to manage, but once I started doing several lectures a month, the financial difficulty became too great. Therefore, I think the fairest way is to charge what it costs me, and then let people decide whether or not they want to invite me, or whether they would prefer to make use of their local resources. Of course, I don't charge anything for lectures and courses in the North East. 

---
**Is there any way to reduce the cost?**

The best way of reducing the cost is to consider organising multiple events in the area, on the same day, or on consecutive days, and sharing the costs between them. Similarly, booking as part of a lecture tour or block booking is always more cost effective, as the travel distance between lectures is likely to be much shorter.

I also suggest avoiding booking short lectures that don't give a great deal of value for money; instead consider a combination of a short lecture for everyone and a workshop for those who want more detail. I personally dislike travelling for several hours to deliver a 45 minute lecture, and much prefer to fill the day with activities which benefit the communities I am travelling to, whether lectures or something else. The only thing that I ask is that the time, inclusive of travelling, doesn't take more than 12 hours, or end up with me getting back to Newcastle after 11pm.  

---
**Should we book your tickets/accommodation for you?**

For all of the transport and accommodation costs, I kindly request that you allow me to make the bookings myself, in order to best accommodate my needs, reduce costs (for example, through loyalty schemes), and to avoid problems that have occurred in the past. An estimate of costs can be provided, as well as all invoices and receipts, in shā' Allāh. 

As a rough idea, you can calculate petrol at 25p/mile from Newcastle upon Tyne, check train journeys and costs from Newcastle Central Station, or check flights from Newcastle International Airport (NCL). 

---
**Do you accept invitations to travel abroad?**

Yes, I am quite happy to travel abroad. However, I can't accept too many of these invitations in a short period of time, due to the effect of doing so on my family and work.

---
**Do you have a short bio that can be used in the introduction?**

Yes, you can use the following:

Muhammad Tim Humble became Muslim at the age of 14. He was accepted to study at the Islamic University of Madeenah in 2004, and graduated from the Faculty of Hadeeth and Islamic Studies in 2011. He has been involved in teaching and da'wah work for several years, and currently resides in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He currently delivers lectures and seminars on a variety of topics, in the UK and abroad. You can see some of the work that Muhammad Tim is involved in on his website: http://muhammadtim.com.  

---
**Do you have a title, like 'shaykh', 'ustadh', etc?**

No, I strongly discourage the use of any of these titles, and prefer to be called by my [kunya:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunya_(Arabic) Abu Abdurrahman, and/or my name: Muhammad Tim Humble.

---
**Do you have any conditions relating to the venues at which you speak?**

I don't have any conditions relating to the venues at which I speak. However, I do ask that the venue is properly segregated (to the best of your ability). 

As a general rule, I do not agree to share a stage or platform with any other speakers during the time that I am there. I am quite strict on this rule, but exceptions will be made where it is reasonable to do so, and with my prior agreement. I don't mind there being a person on stage to introduce the speaker or the topic, but no more than that. This is to avoid me being held responsible for other people's mistakes, or they being held responsible for mine.

My only other request regarding the venue is that I am given an accurate address/postcode **and** description of the location, before setting off. Many times lectures have started late because the address/postcode was either wrong or the location too hard to find upon reaching it. Please also tell me whether or not car parking is available, and where the car park is, if I'm going to be travelling by car.

---
**Do you provide lecture notes or booklets?**

Yes, I'm currently in the process of revamping the website, and the new website will have lecture notes added within a few days of each lecture being delivered. If you need a course booklet or student notes before the course starts, I can usually upload the material early - just let me know, in shā' Allāh.

---
**Can we make a recording of your lecture?**

Yes, that's no problem. However, before sharing or distributing any recording, either online or by traditional means, I need to watch the recording and give approval. This is so that any mistakes can be edited before the video is shared. You can do this by uploading the video privately and sharing a link with me, or by transferring by Dropbox or something similar.

---
**Do you have a phone number we can contact you on?**

I have a phone number that can be given out on request. However, due to the large number of phone calls that I receive, I normally have phone calls blocked. Whatsapp works on the number though, so this is usually the best way. Please also provide a phone number that I can call when I arrive.

**How do we go forward from here?**

If you agree to the above, you can [email me.](/email)
