#Contact Me

One of the things I've tried to do of late is to streamline the way people contact me. For this reason, I've deleted my Facebook account, and I no longer use my old phone number on a regular basis (if you have it, then whatsapp is usually the best way to get in touch).

Instead, I'm trying to focus upon using email for the majority of people who need to get in touch. Email means that I no longer have to worry about missed calls, and it's harder to forget to reply. They're as instant as text messages, and not dependant on someone having my phone number. They're also easy to track and prioritise.

Please read the following carefully, and then you'll find a link to my email at the bottom of the page in shā' Allāh.

**Emails are becoming a problem. Far too many of the emails (both ruqyah and non-ruqyah related) are questions for which the person has done no research at all, and I end up just cutting and pasting links to existing resources. If your queston is related to ruqyah, please:**

* Read every single article on this website
* Watch the ten part [ruqyah training course](http://muhammadtim.com/video#training)
* Put the following into practice: [7 day programme](http://muhammadtim.com/7dayrd), [adhkaar](http://muhammadtim.com/protectys), [practical ruqyah](http://muhammadtim.com/programme) 

**If your question is not related to ruqyah, please:**

* Check existing resources like [islamqa.info](http://islamqa.info)
* Ask people of knowledge in your local area

The more specific the question is the better, so please do try to actually use the resources on the website, rather than just send an email.

Jazākumullāhu khayran!

**PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING:**

* **Please avoid long emails.** Do not start your email with something like, "I know that I'm not supposed to write long emails, but..." I know it's hard, especially when asking for help, but not only does it take much longer to reply to long emails, but it also stops other people from getting a timely response. By all means write a draft that is several pages long, but cut it down by the time you email me (e.g., use bullet points instead of paragraphs, and **keep the story concise**). May Allāh reward the brothers and sisters who have done so; some of the emails have been excellent in this regard. 

* **Please avoid sending lots of follow up emails.** One of the things that I've noticed of late is that many people will send in excess of ten emails in the space of a few hours. It's so bad, that I am often tempted not to respond right away, because the person just responds with another page of questions. If there's something not clear, by all means ask, but I've got to the stage where I have a list of people who send me in excess of 50 emails a month!
 
* If you want to request me to perform ruqyah, you must [read this first](/ruqyah). Note that I only perform ruqyah on the specific day mentioned in the link and I only perform it in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Requests which fall outside of this will likely be refused.

* Please do not include the word **urgent** or any of its synonyms in the subject line, and do not mark the email as important. Every ruqyah case is urgent, and many Islamic questions are urgent, so please do not presume you have more right than the existing people who are waiting for answers.

* **I don't recommend other raaqis except those whom I work with on a regular basis**, namely Basak in Newcastle, and Abu Ibraheem and Mohammed Asghar in Birmingham. That doesn't mean that there aren't other brothers - there are many, and some of them I am very close to - but I've had my fingers burnt too many times. There are many groups who can find you a raaqi in your area, including [Ruqya Support](http://ruqyasupport.com/), [The Ruqyah Room](https://en-gb.facebook.com/TheRuqyaRoom), [Ruqya Directory](http://ruqyahdirectory.com), and others. **I can't vouch for the people they recommend**, I can only encourage you to watch [my videos](/video) which include discussions about what to be wary of.

* I am extremely busy, and **it can often take me in excess of 4 weeks to respond to an email**. Please do not send follow up emails asking why I haven't responded. If you haven't received a response after 4 weeks, you're welcome to chase it up. The only exception to this are emails relating to events/conferences/speeches, in which case you can chase me up as often as you think appropriate. 

If you've read these points and you understand and agree to them, you can find my email [here](http://muhammadtim.com/email).

I have a separate work email, given out on request, for business related queries.
