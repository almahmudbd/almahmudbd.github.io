#Video Mistakes & Corrections

A lot of the lectures that I do end up on YouTube, even though I don't personally record or post any of them. This leads me to be very concerned, since the nature of human beings is that we make mistakes, and while I can accept that I make a mistake once, I can't accept that mistake being repeated thousands of times as people watch the videos.

**There is now a project ongoing to develop notes for every single lecture that I've done, as well as incorporating corrections. If you'd like to volunteer, please send me an [email](/email).**

I also think that there will be some videos that fall short of a general standard, and I will push for those to be removed in shā' Allāh by the people who posted them.

I always welcome feedback and for people to point out my mistakes, as long as that is done in a generally polite way. You can [contact me](/contact) if you find something.

**Please note that if a video is not listed here, that means I haven't yet had time to review it, that doesn't mean that I don't think that it has any mistakes!**
